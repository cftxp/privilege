          Overview: {race} Privilege and {race} Supremacy
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Colonization:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                {race} people ventured outside of their homelands in (homeland)
                to seek other land and resources to plunder.
              </li>
              <li>
                After finding land to plunder as they committed genocide on
                indigenous populations. {race} people, then, explored other
                lands to plunder for the sake of increasing capital gains.
              </li>
              <li>
                {race} people, however, first enslaved the indigenous people of{" "}
                {newWorld} but, due to the introduction of diseases that{" "}
                {indigenous} locals had no immunity to, {race} people killed off
                indigenous {indigenous} populations due to infections, harsh
                labor, outright genocide, among other things.
              </li>
              <li>
                But the systemic genocide of indigenous people meant that {race}{" "}
                people had to find another source of labor, this time, from a
                different location where the population is perceived to be more
                fruitful.
              </li>
              <li>
                Thus, {race} people soon enslaved {enslaved} people and shipped
                them off to {newWorld}, which they called the "New World".
              </li>
              <li>
                Of course, even {othered} people faced the effects of
                colonization, colonial mentality, and imperialism due to (race)
                influence.
              </li>
              <li>
                Since the beginning of {race} exploration of other lands, {race}{" "}
                supremacy has been the predominant global paradigm that has
                defined every aspect of human society.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>{race} Supremacy:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                {race} supremacy is the systemic persecution of non-{race}{" "}
                people and involves the injection of {race}ness in every aspect
                of society, whether it be social, political, economic, and the
                like.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, there is the common misconception that {race} supremacy
                is simply the faction of {race} people who believe in {race}{" "}
                nationalism or {race} people who are extremely racist towards
                non&dash;{race} people.
              </li>
              <li>
                But what does racism actually mean in a world of {race}{" "}
                privilege?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Racism:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                {race} supremacy means that {race} people are privileged solely
                because of their physical characteristics and social standing in
                society.
              </li>
              <li>
                Because of this association between success and purity and{" "}
                {race}ness, the concept of racism is much more than simply acts
                of "bigotry" towards a person of another race/ethnicity by
                someone of another race/ethnicity.
              </li>
              <li>
                Due to their positions of power, anything done by {race} society
                results in systemic consequences.
              </li>
              <li>
                For instance, {race} people have historically used fear and
                physical violence to traumatize the minds of human beings
                belonging to other ethnic groups and, while in recent times,
                violence has been less prevalent, microaggressions and other,
                more covert forms of racism, are still commonplace.
              </li>
              <li>
                But at the root of racism under the paradigm of {race} supremacy
                is the fact that {race} privilege gives a {race} person so much
                power that, many times, {race} people simply cannot understand
                what it is like not to be {race}.
              </li>
              <li>
                This has led to the misguided belief that reverse racism (or
                racist acts towards {race} people) actually exists.
              </li>
              <li>
                The power dynamics at play in modern society under the paradigm
                of {race} supremacy greatly privileges {race} people due to
                their physical characteristics and prominence in a society that
                favors the existence of {race} people.
              </li>
              <li>
                Systemically, it is impossible for {race} people to personally
                understand the effects of racism (much less face the effects of
                racism) as, systemically, they cannot be victims of a system
                that fellow {race} people created based on the supposed
                inferiority of non-{race} people. That's like saying that a
                disabled person can ever be ableist to an able-bodied,
                able-minded person. It's simply absurd!
              </li>
              <li>
                While there is such a thing as racial/ethnic bias towards or
                against certain groups, when it comes to {race} groups, it is
                simply prejudice, while when this bias is directed towards non-
                {race} groups (even by other non-{race} groups), this is what
                should actually be considered racism.
              </li>
              <li>
                Yes, there may actually be violent cases of non-{race} people
                directing anger at {race} people solely due to their victims'{" "}
                {race}ness, but even such acts are not racist (although if you
                are non-{race}, I strongly disagree with wasting your life, time
                or future in a jail or prison cell just because you wanted
                revenge against {race} people knowing that the criminal justice
                system does not and will not favor you).
              </li>
              <li>
                The suspect, in this case, can still never utilize their
                privilege to systemically suppress the cultures of other groups
                who aren't like them because the global paradigm backs {race}{" "}
                supremacy, not that of others!
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Criminal Justice:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Speaking of racism and {race} supremacy, criminal justice in
                places where {race} people are the majority have meant that non-
                {race} people are at an inherent disadvantage.
              </li>
              <li>
                In this world of {race} supremacy, non-{race} people are more
                likely to be incarcerated, have increased rates of recidivism
                (compared to {race} people), are falsely convicted at a higher
                rate than {race} people, are given longer sentences than {race}{" "}
                people, and are executed at a higher rate than {race} people
                where the death penalty is still a constitutional punishment.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is direct the result of overpolicing, outright bias, a
                majority-{race} police force, and the rise of {race}-extremist
                ideologies in police forces.
              </li>
              <li>
                Acknowledge, also, the history of policing, which originated in
                organized attempts to capture enslaved persons of non-{race}{" "}
                descent who had either been freed or escaped slavery, only to be
                captured again by the precursors to the modern police force.
              </li>
              <li>
                Thus, non-{race} people never really stand a chance at true
                justice in the criminal justice system in {race}-majority
                nations as the intersections of {race} supremacy, systemic
                racism, and racism in police forces make it impossible to reach
                the level of freedom, liberty and justice for all that all
                citizens are supposed to be entitled to.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Stereotypes and Social Expectations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                {race} supremacy requires upholding certain social norms that
                favor {race} sensibilities and sensitivities.
              </li>
              <li>
                For instance, when {enslaved} people, and other marginalized
                racial/ethnic groups succeed, they are upheld as the reason why
                racism no longer exists, because they can become doctors,
                lawyers, even President too!
              </li>
              <li>
                However, when someone else who is {enslaved} is arrested,
                commits anti-social behavior, or is murdered by the police, even
                the influential members of the {race} elite act as if they have
                no critical thinking abilities and blame it on the "animalistic"
                nature of {enslaved} people, as opposed to the civilized ideals
                of {race} people.
              </li>
              <li>
                At the same time, the frame of reference is always from the{" "}
                {race} perspective. This is the doing of {race} supremacy and
                how {race} culture has been exported throughout the world.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is why {race} culture is the basis of society's ideals of
                beauty, respectability, and civilization. Ideas like the nation
                state came from Enlightenment ideals in {homeland}'s golden age
                and resulted in foregoing {homeland}'s formerly collectivist
                ideals in favor of individualistic, but highly prejudiced, ideas
                that led to the idealization of the nation-state and justifying{" "}
                {race} colonization of the rest of the world.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some of the other side effects of {race} supremacy in the modern
                world include: colorism, cultural appropriation, othering, and
                orientalism of non-white cultures, the spread of the
                nation-state, hatred for traditional non-Western customs,
                homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism, ableism, antisemitism,
                Islamaphobia, xenophobia, the advent of neo-liberal ideas of
                individual economic freedoms without respect for its
                consequences (e.g. capitalism), and the spread and supremacy of{" "}
                {religion} on a global scale.
